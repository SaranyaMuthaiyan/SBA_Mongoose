Created a RESTFul api using  Node.js, Express and MongoDb  that allows the user to  manage and share the movie , post reviews. I just included the full CRUD operations for the User -Schema, applying some validations and  included proper error handling using express middleware. This  project can be tested using  tools like thunderClient  or postman. I just tested using Thunder Client only.
#Users:

-`GET/ api/users` - List all users
-`POST/api/users` - Create  a new user
-`PATCH/api/users/:id` - Updates the user using id.
-`Delete /api/users/:id` - Delete user using the id.


#Movies:
-`GET/ api/movies` - List all movies
#### review

-`GET/api/reviews` - List all reviews
